Find the current `su` group by running
```bash
grep pam_wheel.so /etc/pam.d/su
```

The output should be `auth required pam_wheel.so use_id group=GROUP_NAME`

If no output is returned, run `groupadd sugroup` to create the group `sugroup`, and then add the following line to `/etc/pam.d/su`.
```
auth required pam_wheel.so use_id group=sugroup
```

If there is an output, check that the group is empty by running `grep GROUP_NAME /etc/group`.
It should return
```
GROUP_NAME:x:GID:
```
with a number as the GID and no users listed after the last colon.
