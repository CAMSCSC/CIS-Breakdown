### 20.18  
Configure directory data outside the root DSE)of a non-public directory to prevent 
anonymous access. 
 
For Active Directory, there are multiple configuration items that could enable anonymous 
access. 
 
Changing the access permissions on the domain naming context object (from the secure 
defaults) could enable anonymous access. If the check procedures indicate this is the cause, 
the process that was used to change the permissions should be reversed. This could have 
been through the Windows Support Tools ADSI Edit console (adsiedit.msc). 
The dsHeuristics option is used. This is addressed in check V-8555 in the Active Directory 
Forest STIG.
