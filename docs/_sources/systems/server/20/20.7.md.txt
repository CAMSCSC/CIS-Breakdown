Maintain the permissions on Group Policy objects to not allow greater than Read and Apply 
group policy for standard user accounts or groups. 
 
The default permissions below meet this requirement: 
 
Authenticated Users - Read, Apply group policy, Special permissions 
 
The special permissions for Authenticated Users are for Read-type Properties. 
 
CREATOR OWNER - Special permissions, SYSTEM - Read, Write, Create all child 
objects, Delete all child objects, Special permissions, Domain Admins - Read, 
Write, Create all child objects, Delete all child objects, Special 
permissions, Enterprise Admins - Read, Write, Create all child objects, Delete 
all child objects, Special permissions, and ENTERPRISE DOMAIN CONTROLLERS - 
Read, Special permissions 
 
Document any other access permissions that allow the objects to be updated with the ISSO. 
The Domain Admins and Enterprise Admins will not have the Delete all child objects 
permission on the two default Group Policy objects: Default Domain Policy and Default 
Domain Controllers Policy. They will have this permission on created Group Policy objects.
