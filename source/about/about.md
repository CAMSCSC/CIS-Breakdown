# CIS Benchmark Breakdown

CIS Benchmark Breakdown is a project by CAMS Computer Science and Cybersecurity
Club, aimed at creating a summarization of the Center for Information
Security's [Benchmarks][CIS Benchmarks].

These benchmarks contain complete guides to locking down a system, but are
often obtuse and hard to read. Our goal is to simplify them into a set of
readable steps to follow in order to lock down a system.

Our target systems are Ubuntu 18, Debian 10, Windows 10, and Windows Server
2019, which are the main images found in the AFA Cyberpatriot Competition.
More information about the competition can be found [here][Cyberpatriot].
