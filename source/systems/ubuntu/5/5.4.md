Ensure that `pam_pwquality` is installed by running `apt-get install libpam-pwquality`.

In `/etc/security/pwquality.conf`, ensure that the password requirements are
`minlen = 14` or higher and either `minclass = 4` or `dcredit = -1`, `ucredit = -1`, `ocredit = -1`, `lcredit = -1`

Then edit `/etc/pam.d/common-password` to contain `retry=3` and
```
password required pam_pwhistory.so remember=5
password [success=1 default=ignore] pam_unix.so sha512
```

Configure password lockouts by editing `/etc/pam.d/common-auth` to contain:
```
auth required pam_tally2.so onerr=fail audit silent deny=5 unlock_time=900
```
Then add to `/etc/pam.d/common-account`: 
```
account requisite pam_deny.so
account required pam_tally2.so
```
