### 1.7.1 - Ensure MoTD is configured properly

If a message of the day is not needed, run `rm /etc/motd`.

### 1.7.2 - 1.7.4 - Ensure permissions on motd files are configured

Set the permissions on `/etc/issue.net`, `/etc/issue`, and `/etc/motd` (if it exists) by running:
```bash
chown root:root /etc/issue.net
chmod u-x,go-wx /etc/issue.net
chown root:root /etc/issue
chmod u-x,go-wx /etc/issue
chown root:root /etc/motd
chmod u-x,go-wx /etc/motd
```

### 1.7.5 - 1.7.6 - Ensure warning banners are configured properly

Edit `/etc/issue.net` (remote login warning) or `/etc/issue` (local login warning) to fit with README instructions if necessary.
