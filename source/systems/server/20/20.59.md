Remove any certificate installation files *.p12 and *.pfx found on a system. 
Note: The Certificate Store can be loaded by executing the Microsoft Management Console 
(MMC) and loading the Certificates snap-in. 
Note #2: This does not apply to server-based applications that have a requirement for .p12 
certificate files or Adobe PreFlight certificate files. Some applications create files with 
extensions of .p12 that are not certificate installation files. Removal of non-certificate 
installation files from systems is not required. These must be documented with the ISSO.
